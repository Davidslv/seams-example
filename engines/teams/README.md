## Events consumed

| Event name              | Subscriber                       | What it does |
| ---                     | ---                              | --- |
| `invitation.sent.teams` | `Teams::InvitationSubscriber`    | Looks up the invitation by id and enqueues `Teams::InvitationMailer.invite(invitation_id).deliver_later`. The host overrides the email body at `app/views/teams/invitation_mailer/invite.text.erb`. |

## Exposed concerns

| Concern              | Purpose                                                             |
| ---                  | ---                                                                 |
| `Teams::Teamable`    | Mix into the host's user model for `teams`, `team_memberships`, `member_of?`, `admin_of?`, `owner_of?` helpers. |

## Roles

| Role     | Capabilities |
| ---      | --- |
| `owner`  | Everything an admin can, plus deleting the team. |
| `admin`  | Manage memberships and invitations. |
| `member` | Read-only by default. |

The engine ships role enforcement at the model level (`Membership#admin?`).
Authorization in controllers is the host's responsibility — Seams gives
you the data and the events; opinion-free on which authz library you use.

## Mounting

# config/routes.rb (host application)
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount Teams::Engine, at: "/teams"
end
```

## Running the specs
