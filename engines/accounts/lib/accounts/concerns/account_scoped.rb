module Accounts
  # Mix into any model whose rows belong to a single Account. Adds:
  #
  #   - `belongs_to :account, class_name: "Accounts::Account"`
  #   - a default_scope filtered to `Accounts::Current.account`. When
  #     `Accounts::Current.account` is unset, the scope returns `none`
  #     (an empty relation) — see "fail-closed" below.
  #   - presence validation on `account`
  #
  #   class AuditEntry < ApplicationRecord
  #     include Accounts::AccountScoped
  #   end
  #
  #   Accounts::Current.account = account
  #   AuditEntry.create!(action: "...")  # account_id auto-assigned
  #   AuditEntry.all                     # only this account's rows
  #
  # ### Fail-closed default
  #
  # When `Accounts::Current.account` is nil, the default_scope returns
  # `none` rather than `all`. Rationale: the alternative (return all
  # rows across all tenants when no account is bound) is the canonical
  # multi-tenant data-leak bug. A forgotten `Current.account=` in a
  # background job, an admin tool, or a Rails console session would
  # otherwise hand the operator another tenant's data without warning.
  # Fail-closed surfaces "I have no rows" — a noisy symptom the
  # developer fixes immediately — instead of a silent leak.
  #
  # Opt-out paths (use deliberately):
  #   * `.unscoped` — full Active Record bypass; loses every default
  #     scope including soft-delete + sluggable; reserved for
  #     platform-admin / impersonation flows gated on
  #     `Auth::Current.identity.staff?`.
  #   * `.with_no_account_scope` — returns the relation as if the
  #     model were not account-scoped; preserves any other
  #     default_scopes the model declares; intended for seed scripts,
  #     migrations, and platform tooling.
  #
  # Background jobs MUST set `Accounts::Current.account =` before
  # querying, or use `.with_no_account_scope` explicitly. The shape:
  #
  #   class IngestionJob < ApplicationJob
  #     def perform(account_id, payload)
  #       Accounts::Current.account = Accounts::Account.find(account_id)
  #       AuditEntry.create!(...)   # auto-scoped
  #     end
  #   end

      # This shape is intentional: it lets `unscope(where: :account_id)`
      # in `with_no_account_scope` reverse the filter cleanly. Using

      # un-do.
