  # Read-only billing history for the current Account. The local
  # Billing::Invoice rows are populated by the InvoiceHandlerBase
  # webhook handlers as Stripe fires invoice.* events; SyncService
  # can refresh on demand.
  #
  # No `download` action — Stripe hosts the PDF; link to the
  # `hosted_invoice_url` Stripe returns on the invoice object. Saves
  # us from being a redirect proxy for content we do not own.
  #
  #   GET /billing/invoices       → index (paginated history)
  #   GET /billing/invoices/:id   → show
