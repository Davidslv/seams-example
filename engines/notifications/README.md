# Notifications

> In-app + email + SMS notifications, scheduled or recurring, for a
> Seams-powered host. STI delivery strategies, ice_cube schedules,
> swappable adapters.

## Model

`Notifications::Notification` is an STI base. Three concrete
subclasses, each implementing its own `#dispatch!`:

| Class                                | Channel | Dispatches via                                            |
| ---                                  | ---     | ---                                                       |
| `Notifications::Strategies::InApp`   | in-app  | ActionCable broadcast to the per-recipient channel        |
| `Notifications::Strategies::Email`   | email   | `Notifications.email_adapter.deliver(notification:)`      |
| `Notifications::Strategies::Sms`     | sms     | `Notifications.sms_adapter.deliver(notification:)`        |

Every Notification belongs to an `owner` (polymorphic), names a
`template` (an ERB filename), and carries an ice_cube schedule
serialised to a `schedule_data` jsonb column. `next_delivery_at` is
the indexed cache the recurring sweeper reads from.

## Scheduling

```ruby
# Send right now (default if you skip schedule_config)
user.notify(strategy: :email, template: "welcome")

# Send in 24h
user.notify(
  strategy: :email,
  template: "trial_ending",
  schedule_config: { starts_at: 1.day.from_now, frequency: "once" }
)

# Weekly digest
user.notify(
  strategy: :email,
  template: "weekly_digest",
  schedule_config: {
    starts_at: Time.current.next_week,
    frequency: "weekly",
    interval:  1
  }
)

# Monthly, capped at 12 occurrences
user.notify(
  strategy: :email,
  template: "anniversary",
  schedule_config: {
    starts_at: Time.current,
    frequency: "monthly",
    count:     12
  }
)
```

Or assemble the schedule yourself for richer rules (exception dates,
"first Tuesday of the month", etc.):

```ruby
sched = IceCube::Schedule.new(Time.current)
sched.add_recurrence_rule(
  IceCube::Rule.weekly.day(:monday).hour_of_day(9)
)
notification = user.notifications.create!(
  type:     "Notifications::Strategies::Email",
  template: "monday_morning"
)
notification.schedule = sched
notification.save!
```

## Sweeper

`Notifications::SendDueNotificationsJob` is a plain `ApplicationJob`
that finds every `Notification.due` and enqueues a per-row
`SendNotificationJob`. Wire it into your queue's recurring
scheduler. With Rails 8's Solid Queue:

```yaml
# config/recurring.yml
production:
  notifications_dispatcher:
    class: Notifications::SendDueNotificationsJob
    schedule: every minute
```

## Events emitted

| Event name | Payload | Emitted when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `notification.queued.notifications`     | `{ id:, type:, owner_id: }`           | `Notification#send!` begins |
| `notification.delivered.notifications`  | `{ id:, type:, owner_id: }`           | `dispatch!` succeeded + Delivery recorded |
| `notification.failed.notifications`     | `{ id:, type:, error: }`              | `dispatch!` raised |

## Events consumed

| Event name | Subscriber | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `user.signed_up.auth` | `Notifications::AuthSubscriber` | Creates an InApp + Email welcome notification (subject to NotificationPreference). |
| `subscription.created.billing`  | `Notifications::BillingSubscriber` | InApp notification, template `billing/subscription_started`. |
| `subscription.updated.billing`  | `Notifications::BillingSubscriber` | InApp notification, template `billing/subscription_updated`. |
| `subscription.canceled.billing` | `Notifications::BillingSubscriber` | InApp notification, template `billing/subscription_canceled`. |
| `invoice.paid.billing`          | `Notifications::BillingSubscriber` | InApp notification, template `billing/invoice_paid`. |
| `invoice.failed.billing`        | `Notifications::BillingSubscriber` | InApp notification, template `billing/invoice_failed`. |
| `lifetime.granted.billing`      | `Notifications::BillingSubscriber` | InApp notification, template `billing/lifetime_granted`. |
| `lifetime.purchased.billing`    | `Notifications::BillingSubscriber` | InApp notification, template `billing/lifetime_purchased`. |

The Billing subscriber resolves the host User by
`stripe_customer_id` (the column the `Billing::Billable` concern
documents). It only attaches when `Billing::Engine` is loaded.

### Cross-engine dependencies

The subscribers in this engine reach into other engines' models and
the host User class. This dependency direction is intentional but
worth documenting explicitly:

| Subscriber | Reaches into | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Notifications::AuthSubscriber`    | host `::User` class    | resolve owner from `host_user_id` payload |
| `Notifications::BillingSubscriber` | host `::User` class    | resolve owner from `customer_ref` via `stripe_customer_id` column |
| `Notifications::CreateNotificationJob` | host `::User` class | resolve owner before creating the Notification |

If you have a host whose user-facing class isn't `::User`, the
default subscribers won't find owners. Override by writing your own
subscriber that publishes `Notifications::CreateNotificationJob`
with your class name in `owner_class:`.

### Subscribers enqueue, never block the publisher

`Seams::Events::Publisher` runs subscribers synchronously in the
publisher's thread. Every subscriber here therefore enqueues
`Notifications::CreateNotificationJob` (which does the actual DB
write + send) rather than calling `Notification.create!` inline.
Publishing should never wait on the bus.

## Exposed concerns

| Concern | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Notifications::Notifiable` | Mix into the host's user model for `notifications` association + `#notify(strategy:, template:, schedule_config:)` helper. |

## Adapters

| Interface | Default                                  | Override via                                                                  |
| ---       | ---                                      | ---                                                                           |
| Email     | `Notifications::Adapters::ActionMailer`  | `Notifications.configure { \|c\| c.email_adapter = "MyApp::MailgunAdapter" }` |
| SMS       | `Notifications::Adapters::NullSms`       | `Notifications.configure { \|c\| c.sms_adapter   = "MyApp::TwilioAdapter" }`  |

To add a new adapter, subclass `Notifications::Adapters::Abstract`
and implement `#deliver(notification:)`. The adapter receives the
full Notification so it can read `recipient`, `template`,
`rendered_content`, `owner` — whatever the gateway needs.

## Templates

Notifications are rendered via ERB files looked up in this order:

1. `app/views/notifications/templates/<name>.erb` in the host
2. `app/views/notifications/templates/<name>.erb` in the engine

Drop a file in your host to override. The notification is exposed in
the template via the local variable `notification` — use
`notification.owner`, `notification.recipient`, etc.

## Preferences

`Notifications::NotificationPreference` lets a user opt out by
channel + notification_type:

```ruby
Notifications::NotificationPreference.enabled?(
  user_id: 42, channel: "email", notification_type: "weekly_digest"
) # => true (default) | false (if a row says enabled: false)
```

The shipped `AuthSubscriber` consults this before creating the
Email Notification at signup.

## Running the specs

```bash
bin/rails seams:test[notifications]
```
