module Notifications
  # OPTIONAL convenience concern. Adds a +notifications+ has_many
  # association + a +#notify+ helper to whatever model includes it.
  # Notifications themselves are polymorphic — every Notification has
  # an +owner+, which can be ANY ActiveRecord model. You don't need
  # this concern to attach notifications to a model:
  #
  #   Notifications::Notification.create!(owner: anything, template: ...)
  #
  # The concern is just sugar for the receiving side.
  #
  # Three include patterns hosts can pick from:
  #
  # 1. Wire into Auth::Identity (most common for canonical seams hosts
  #    after Wave 9 — the "human" is Auth::Identity, not a host User):
  #
  #    # config/initializers/notifications.rb
  #    Rails.application.config.to_prepare do
  #      Auth::Identity.include(Notifications::Notifiable)
  #    end
  #
  # 2. Wire into a host-defined User class (older hosts that still
  #    keep their own User model alongside Auth::Identity):
  #
  #    class User < ApplicationRecord
  #      include Notifications::Notifiable
  #    end
  #
  # 3. Don't include the concern at all. Create notifications via
  #    +Notifications::Notification.create!(owner: ..., template: ...)+
  #    or the per-strategy classes directly. The polymorphic +owner+
  #    column doesn't care.
  #
  # Once included:
  #
  #   target.notify(strategy: :email,  template: "welcome")
  #   target.notify(strategy: :sms,    template: "alert", schedule_config: { starts_at: 1.day.from_now, frequency: "once" })
  #   target.notify(strategy: :in_app, template: "system")
