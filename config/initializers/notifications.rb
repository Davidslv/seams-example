# Configuration for the Notifications engine.
#
# Adapters
# --------
# Email defaults to Notifications::Adapters::ActionMailer (delegates to
# the engine's NotificationMailer). SMS defaults to a no-op NullSms
# adapter that logs and drops. Swap either by assigning a class name
# (a string — resolved via constantize at delivery time so the host
# doesn't have to require the adapter at boot):
#
#   Notifications.configure do |config|
#     config.email_adapter = "MyApp::MailgunAdapter"
#     config.sms_adapter   = "MyApp::TwilioAdapter"
#   end
#
# Optional: Notifiable concern
# ----------------------------
# Notifications work without the concern — every Notification has a
# polymorphic `owner`, and `Notifications::Notification.create!(owner: anything, ...)`
# is the always-supported path.
#
# The concern is OPTIONAL sugar: it adds a `notifications` has_many
# association and a `#notify(strategy:, template:)` helper to whatever
# class includes it. Pick one of the patterns below if you want that
# convenience.
#
# Pattern A — wire onto Auth::Identity (canonical post-Wave-9 host).
# Active in the seams-example demo so `db/seeds.rb`, `host_boot_spec`,
# and the bell partial all see `identity.notify(...)` available.
Rails.application.config.to_prepare do
  Auth::Identity.include(Notifications::Notifiable)
end
#
# Pattern B — wire onto a host User class (hosts that keep their own
# domain User alongside Auth::Identity):
#
#   class User < ApplicationRecord
#     include Notifications::Notifiable
#   end
#
# Pattern C — don't include the concern at all. Use
# `Notifications::Notification.create!(owner: ..., template: ...)` or
# the per-strategy classes directly.
#
# Default subscriber
# ------------------
# Notifications::AuthSubscriber listens for `identity.signed_up.auth`
# and creates an InApp + Email welcome notification owned by the
# Auth::Identity. To redirect the welcome notification at a different
# owner (an Account, a Membership, a host User), copy
# `engines/notifications/app/subscribers/notifications/auth_subscriber.rb`
# into your host's app/subscribers/, change `OWNER_CLASS_NAME` and the
# resolution rule, then re-attach in this initializer:
#
#   Rails.application.config.to_prepare do
#     Notifications::AuthSubscriber.attach!
#   end
